# Katas 

This repository contains exercises that I came across for different reasons. My intention to is to:

- Expose the flawed solution as a starting point
- Learn from the feedback I was given as to why it was not considered good (if I get any)
- Refine the solution based on that feedback and 
- **Learn from my mistakes**

This might prove useful for some (if anyone ever lands in this repo). I now it should be good for me at least so I step up my game. 

Ideally, the exercise's intent, the feedback and the subsequence changes will be included in the **readme.md** file.
